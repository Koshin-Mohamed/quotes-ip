This website's purpose is to provide the user with a place to insert their favorite quotes and list them. 

## BDD

When the user enters the website their is a form where they can enter their favorite quote the, author, and the user's info.

Then the user quote is generated along with a button to see the contributor, delete the quote, like the quote, or dislike the quote.
